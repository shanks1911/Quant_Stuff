# 🧠 Quant Snowball Series: A Project-Based Learning Journey


---

🎯 **Why This Exists**

I created this repo to:

- 📚 Structure my learning in a progressive, hands-on way  
- 💼 Build a portfolio that reflects real-world quant and data-driven finance work  
- 🧪 Reinforce theory through code, intuition, and experimentation  
- 📈 Track long-term progress toward mastering quantitative research and trading  

I’m especially interested in the intersection of **mathematics, data, and markets** — this repo captures my exploration of that space through **weekly, iterative projects** designed to mimic real-world quant workflows.

📂 **Topics Covered / In Progress**

- 📈 Asset returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio analysis  
- 📉 Drawdown tracking and risk visualization  
- 🔁 Mean reversion, cointegration, and statistical arbitrage  
- 🧮 Factor models (CAPM, Fama-French, multi-factor regressions)  
- 📊 Portfolio construction and optimization  
- 📚 Hypothesis testing and signal validation  
- 🧠 Machine learning for alpha generation  
- 🛠️ Custom backtesting frameworks and strategy simulation  
- 💼 Multi-strategy portfolio analytics and dashboarding  

Each topic is embedded within a **self-contained, end-to-end project**, with concepts building cumulatively over time. All data is real market data, and tools used reflect those seen in actual quant roles.

✍️ **Note**

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a polished product showcase.  
Some notebooks contain raw exploration, intermediate results, or open questions — and that’s intentional. The goal is to **stay transparent** about the process while building a body of work that shows real growth over time.

If you're reviewing this as part of an internship, job application, or mentorship program — I’d be happy to walk through the code or thinking behind any part of it.
