# Quant_Stuff 📘💹

This repository is a collection of projects I've been working on to deepen my understanding of **quantitative finance**.

Rather than following a purely theoretical or course-based path, I decided to take a **project-based approach** — learning key quant and financial concepts by building small but focused implementations around them. The goal is to gradually build a strong foundation in areas like **risk modeling**, **portfolio analytics**, **strategy backtesting**, **time series forecasting**, and more.

Each project typically corresponds to a week’s worth of learning and includes:
- 🧠 Code implementations in Python 
- 📝 Notes and write-ups explaining the concepts and decisions
- 📊 Real-world data and visualizations
- ⚙️ A focus on both **financial understanding** and **practical implementation**

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I created this repo to:
- 📚 Structure my learning in a progressive, hands-on way
- 💼 Build a portfolio of work that reflects real-world quant applications
- 🧪 Reinforce theoretical concepts through code and experimentation
- 📈 Track long-term progress as I explore more advanced topics

I'm especially interested in the intersection of **data, mathematics, and markets** — and this repository reflects my exploration of that space through weekly, iterative learning.

## 📂 Topics Covered / In Progress

- 📈 Asset returns, volatility, and risk metrics  
- 📊 Portfolio performance and drawdown analysis  
- 🔁 Time series models and stationarity tests  
- 🧮 Factor models (CAPM, Fama-French, multi-factor regression)  
- 🧠 Optimization and risk-adjusted portfolio allocation  
- 📉 Strategy design and backtesting frameworks  
- 📚 Research-based modeling and validation  

Each topic is explored through a self-contained project, with concepts building cumulatively over time.

## ✍️ Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a polished product showcase. Some notebooks may contain exploratory code, intermediate insights, or ongoing questions — and that's intentional. My aim is to stay transparent about the learning process while building a body of work that reflects real growth.

If you're reviewing this as part of an application or evaluation, I'd be happy to walk through any part of it.
